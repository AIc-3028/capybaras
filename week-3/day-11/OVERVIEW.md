## Lab

### OOP Practice

1. Create five different classes that can later be instatiated as objects.
2. Have at least two of these objects act as superclasses and extend them. 
3. Create an interface and implement it in one of your classes. 



## Hand in Assignments
>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.

### Animals Inheritance!

1. Create at least five different animal classes with a few class variables and methods.
2. For two of your animals, create super classes that your animals will extend. Think of the "is-a" relationship model (for example, a turtle *is-a* reptile).
3. Push your code to GitHub!
