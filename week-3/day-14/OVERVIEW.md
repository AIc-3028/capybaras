## Lab

### Exceptions Lab

1. Create a try and catch block that will explicitly throw a built-in exception (something like `NullPointerException`).
2. Create a try and catch block and use the keyword `throw` in order to throw an exception.
3. Create a custom exception class and throw that exception in another try and catch block.

## Hand in Assignments

>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.

### HackerRank Challenge

1. Go to https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java and complete the following challenges:
   - Java Exception Handling (Try-catch)
2. Take a screenshot of your progress and upload it to TiTuS.
