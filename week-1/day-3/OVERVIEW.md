## Lab

### HTML/CSS

1. Work on your HTML/CSS fundamentals. 
2. Practice some CSS! See if you can make a few classes in a seperate stylesheet. Be sure to link your `.css` file to your `.html` document.


## Hand in Assignments

### Agile Jira Lab

1. Go to https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira and make an account.
2. Create a new project and select the kanban template. 
3. Follow the slides instructions and fill out your kanban board. 
4. Take a screenshot and upload it to TiTuS. 

## Notes and Links


- I personally don't use Jira but it's a very valuable resource all the same. My personal favorite is GitHub Projects. 
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) is another option. It strictly deals with the kanban board. 
- Love the Wubzy fanpage, Cristian!
