## Lab


### Handmade LinkedList implementation

- Following the steps on TiTuS, implement your own LinkedList data structure!
- What are some of the difficulties that you encountered? 
- I'll attempt the lab in class myself.


## Hand in Assignments
>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.

### Sorting Assignment

1. Follow the steps outlined on TiTuS, picking one of the two options. (Don't feel the need to create a sorting algorithm from scratch!)
2. Upload your assignment as a zip. 


### HackerRank Challenge 

1. Go to https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java and complete the following challenges: 
    - Java Arraylist
2. Take a screenshot of your progress and upload it to TiTuS.


## Notes and Links

- Sorting fundamentals with visualizations via TopTal
- Sorting is something we failed to cover in class but [you can review some basic sort implementations on this website](https://www.baeldung.com/java-sorting)
