# April 27, 2020 - Day 6

## Agenda 

- Explore the Java control flow statements: decision, looping, and branching. 
- Keep working on our HackerRank challenges.

## Lab

### Java Control Flow Quiz

1. We'll have time in class to complete the quiz located on TiTuS.
2. If you want to retake the quiz, you'll have a week to do before it closes on May 6th. 


## Hand in Assignments
>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.


### Java Control Flow Project

1. Take the time in class to complete the Java Control Flow Project. 
2. Zip up your project and upload it to TiTuS. Windows should allow you to natively compress folders and files but if there are any complications, go ahead and use a third party tool like *7-Zip*.
3. You'll have until the end of the week on Sunday to hand in your assignment. 



### HackerRank Challenge

1. Go to https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java and complete the following challenges: 
    - Java Loops I
2. Take a screenshot of your progress and upload it to TiTuS.


## Notes and Links


- If you need a third-party tool to create a link, [7-Zip comes highly recommended](https://www.7-zip.org/).

- Today I mentioned the concept of *imperative programming*. Strictly speaking, imperative programming refers to a paradigm of coding that dictates a programs *state* using *statements*. You can think of it as giving your program commands. Compare and contrast with *declarative programming* which does not care about the *how* but the *what* of your code. Thus you would declare what you want to use in your program as opposed to describing how you would use them. 

- When comparing strings, you would want to use a helper method such as `.equals()` or `.compareTo()`. This is due to the way Java creates its objects. Thank you Cristian Ponce for the tip!

## Errata

- Dummy moment of the day for me: forgetting the nature of string equality in Java. Be aware that you cannot simply check equality with a `==` operator. We will be covering why this is the case at a later date.
