## Lab

### Practicing Spring Boot

1. In your Spring Boot application, create at least two different endpoints that return Strings.
2. Create a class that will later be instatiated and returned by another endpoint.
3. See if you can implement another HTTP method into your code (something like `DELETE` or `POST`).

## Hand in Assignments

>these are expected to be handed in through TiTuS.

## Notes and Links

### Baeldung H2 Database Guide

- Baeldung is a greate resource for spring. They are the creators of Spring and have a lot of well written articles about the framework. [This one targets setting up H2](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-h2-database).

- [Here is a full article on bootstrapping a Spring Boot App](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-start).

- Q: *Why do you use gradle and not maven?* A: You may have noticed the previous example used maven instead of gradle. While using maven is *fine*, I don't recommend it's use for many reasons. For one, XML can be a pain to read; gradle is human-readable. Secondly, poorly formatted XML is easy to create and difficult to debug. Lastly, building with gradle is simple and intuitive.
